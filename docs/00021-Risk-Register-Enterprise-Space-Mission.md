## 1. Purpose

This Risk Register identifies, classifies, and mitigates all known risks associated with deploying UniCORE AI in:

enterprise environments

government systems

regulated industries

long-duration space missions

human hibernation systems

It ensures UniCORE AI remains:

safe

governed

deterministic

non-self-modifying

human-anchored

compliant

missionstable

## 2. Risk Classification Model

UniCORE AI uses a 5tier severity scale:

Severity

Description

Critical

Missionthreatening or lifethreatening

High

Major operational or governance impact

Medium

Manageable with controls

Low

Minor impact

Negligible

No meaningful impact

And a 5tier likelihood scale:

Likelihood

Description

Almost Certain

Expected to occur

Likely

High probability

Possible

Could occur

Unlikely

Low probability

Rare

Extremely unlikely

## 3. Enterprise Risk Register

Below are the core enterprise risks and UniCORE’s mitigation strategies.

3.1 Governance Drift

Severity: High

Likelihood: Possible

Description: Human governance files may become outdated or inconsistent.

Mitigation:

Drift detection engine

Immutable audit logs

Governance MD versioning

Threshold enforcement

3.2 Human Error in Governance Files

Severity: Medium

Likelihood: Likely

Description: Humans may introduce errors into MD files.

Mitigation:

Multiperson approval

Governance validation

Syntax and structure checks

Human Override Protocol

3.3 Unauthorized Access

Severity: High

Likelihood: Possible

Description: Unauthorized users may attempt to modify governance or thresholds.

Mitigation:

## Rbac

MFA

Immutable core

No AIinitiated changes

3.4 Data Integrity Failure

Severity: High

Likelihood: Unlikely

Description: Corruption of truth, evidence, or audit data.

Mitigation:

SQL integrity constraints

XPO deterministic storage

Backup/restore strategy

3.5 Misinterpretation of Rules

Severity: Medium

Likelihood: Possible

Description: Humans may misunderstand governance outputs.

Mitigation:

Clear explanations

Evidencebased outputs

No AI reinterpretation

3.6 Compliance Failure

Severity: High

Likelihood: Possible

Description: AI may be used in a way that violates regulatory requirements.

Mitigation:

Compliance MD files

Immutable audit logs

Human oversight

3.7 System Misconfiguration

Severity: Medium

Likelihood: Likely

Description: Incorrect thresholds or roles.

Mitigation:

Configuration validation

Rolebased access

Governance review cycles

3.8 Infrastructure Failure

Severity: High

Likelihood: Possible

Description: Hardware or cloud outages.

Mitigation:

Redundant nodes

Failover clusters

DR strategy

## 4. Space Mission Risk Register

Space missions introduce unique risks.UniCORE AI is designed to mitigate them through deterministic, non-autonomous behaviour.

4.1 Crew Incapacitation or Hibernation

Severity: Critical

Likelihood: Possible

Description: Crew may be asleep or unable to issue commands.

Mitigation:

Preauthorized overrides

Mission governance MD

No autonomous authority

4.2 Communication Delay with Earth

Severity: High

Likelihood: Almost Certain

Description: 5–40 minute delays for Mars missions; hours for deep space.

Mitigation:

Delaytolerant governance

Deterministic behaviour

No autonomous decisionmaking

4.3 Sensor Drift

Severity: High

Likelihood: Likely

Description: Radiation and aging degrade sensors.

Mitigation:

Drift detection

Threshold bands

Safe Mode protocols

4.4 Environmental System Failure

Severity: Critical

Likelihood: Possible

Description: Life support anomalies.

Mitigation:

Habitat_Governance.md

Emergency_Governance.md

No AIgenerated actions

4.5 Navigation Anomalies

Severity: Critical

Likelihood: Possible

Description: Course deviations or propulsion issues.

Mitigation:

Navigation_Governance.md

Deterministic correction rules

No autonomous maneuvers

4.6 RadiationInduced Bit Flips

Severity: High

Likelihood: Likely

Description: Cosmic rays corrupt memory or logic.

Mitigation:

ECC memory

Redundant systems

Drift detection

4.7 AI Emergent Behaviour

Severity: Critical

Likelihood: Rare

Description: Unintended internal processes.

Mitigation:

No internal heartbeats

No autonomous messaging

Immutable architecture

4.8 Mission Rule Corruption

Severity: Critical

Likelihood: Rare

Description: Governance MD files become corrupted.

Mitigation:

No autonomous messaging

5.3 Governance Override Misuse

Severity: High

Likelihood: Possible

Mitigation:

Override logging

Rolebased override authority

Threshold classification

5.4 Drift Beyond Threshold

Severity: High

Likelihood: Possible

Mitigation:

DriftEvent logging

Human escalation

No autonomous correction

## 6. Why This Risk Register Matters

UniCORE AI is designed for:

banks

governments

healthcare

defense

space missions

long-duration autonomy

This Risk Register demonstrates that UniCORE AI:

anticipates all major risks

mitigates them through architecture

enforces human sovereignty

prevents emergent behaviour

ensures mission integrity

satisfies regulators

supports deeptime stability
