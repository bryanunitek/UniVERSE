## 1. Purpose

This document defines the deployment topology under which a UniCORE Solution — Powered by UniCORE AI, built on the TrueAI Foundation — can be produced by a human working with AI without breaking the Foundation.

It answers one question: *who is allowed to sit in front of an AI Claw and produce work that will be claimed as TrueAI-aligned?*

The Nine Invariants define what the AI system itself must be. This document defines the human-AI pairing topology under which work claiming to satisfy those invariants can be produced. Topology is not architecture — but the wrong topology produces ungovernable output from an otherwise governable architecture.

This principle sits alongside the Gift Principle. It is not a tenth invariant; it is a deployment rule that the invariants assume.

## 2. The rule

A human producing work on or under the TrueAI Foundation operates with **one AI Claw per workstream**. The AI Claw operates with **one human**. The pairing is singular on both sides.

Personal-assistant use is distinct and unrestricted in shape: a human's personal Claw may hold multiple profiles (for example, a Business Assistant profile and a Personal Assistant profile), because personal assistance is not the production of TrueAI-aligned Solutions.

Solution-producing Claws do not share humans. Humans do not run multiple parallel Solution-producing Claws. Each project — the codebase, the public documentation, a client-specific integration, any other distinct Solution — receives its own Claw.

---

## 3. Why the separation is mandatory

Without project-separated Claws, drift becomes unavoidable between the AI and the human producing the work. A TrueAI-aligned output cannot be produced from a Claw that is simultaneously carrying context, conventions, and decisions from multiple projects. The Foundation demands traceability of every decision to a named human authority on a specific work item; cross-project Claws break that traceability at the session level before any governance file ever sees the work.

Without singular human pairing, the Claw receives conflicting authority signals from humans who have not synchronised their intent. The AI cannot reconcile those signals without assuming authority it does not have. Either the AI invents a reconciliation — violating No Authority Assumption and No Emergent Behaviour — or it blocks, in which case the pairing was never viable. Committee-at-the-session-level does not work.

The constraint from the author: *it will not work.*

---

## 4. Operational patterns

The singular pairing rule admits two operational patterns. Both preserve 1:1 at every Claw. Neither permits multiple humans on a single Claw or a single human running multiple parallel Solution-producing Claws.

### Pattern 1 — Direct Singular Pairing

One human plus one Claw produces the Solution directly. Smallest viable shape. Suitable for Solutions that fit the bandwidth of a single pairing.

The named human is the Solution's author, certifier, and Level 12 sovereign for that Solution. The Claw is their governed tool.

### Pattern 2 — Parallel Isolation with Fresh Synthesis

Multiple isolated singular pairings work in parallel on the same problem space. Each pair is independent: own Claw, own context, own working materials, no cross-traffic between pairs during prototyping. Each pair produces a prototype.

At synthesis, a **new** pair — one new human plus one new Claw, neither of whom participated in any prototype pair — reviews all of the prototypes and produces the actual UniCORE Solution.

**Pattern boundaries:**

- The synthesis pair is itself a singular pairing: 1 human, 1 Claw, no committee.
- Prototype pairs do not exchange material with each other during the prototyping phase. Isolation is what makes the parallelism honest.
- A small human board may sit above any pair, including the synthesis pair, but does not share any pair's session.

**Why the synthesis pair must be fresh.** If the synthesis pair contained any of the prototype humans, that human would be evaluating their own work. The Foundation does not tolerate that conflict at a load-bearing decision. The freshness requirement protects the synthesis from context capture and ensures the Solution is owned by a pair that did not invent any of the inputs it integrates. The same applies to the Claw: a fresh Claw enters the synthesis without inheriting the working assumptions of any prototype Claw. Context isolation at the AI side is as important as conflict-of-interest avoidance at the human side.

**What the synthesis pair does.** Reviews all prototypes against the Nine Invariants and against the problem statement; selects, merges, rejects, or rewrites material from the prototypes as required; produces a single, coherent Solution; and owns the certification attestation for the Solution they produced.

**Where authority attaches.** The synthesis human is the named human for the Solution. Prototype humans are named authorities only for their respective prototypes. The Solution's certification attestation, Level 12 sovereignty, and public byline all belong to the synthesis pair. Prototype humans receive attribution — they did the work — but authority over the Solution belongs to the synthesis pair.

## 5. Producer qualification — Generation IT

The humans producing a UniCORE Enterprise Solution — in either Pattern 1 or Pattern 2 — must belong to **Generation IT**: practitioners with 30+ years of professional IT experience whose career arc covers the full enterprise software era end-to-end.

This is not a credential. It is a statement about the mental model required to produce something the Nine Invariants can be enforced over. *End-to-end* here means the full vertical: data, persistence, business logic, services, integration, presentation, security, identity, governance, audit, deployment, and operations — lived through the technology transitions that built each layer.

### Why Generation IT is the floor

The Nine Invariants demand a producer who can recognise governance failure wherever it emerges in the stack — Levels 1–12 of UniCORE AI's vertical model. A producer who has not lived all twelve cannot reliably tell which level a symptom is coming from, and the Solution they ship will be quietly ungovernable in the layer they have not met. Layer-specialist seniority does not substitute for full-vertical longevity. Neither does any quantity of AI assistance.

### What this rules out

- A junior developer paired with a Claw, however capable the Claw.
- A senior developer of one layer (frontend, backend, data, infrastructure) who has not lived the full vertical.
- A team of any size where no individual carries the end-to-end model in their head.
- AI producing the Solution alone.

### Consequence for Pattern 2

Under Pattern 2, the synthesis human is the named author of the Solution and must satisfy the Generation IT requirement. Prototype humans must also satisfy it; the parallelism is between Generation IT pairs, not between pairs of mixed seniority. The freshness requirement and the Generation IT requirement compound: the synthesis pair is Generation IT *and* uninvolved in the prototyping.

### Succession

Generation IT is a finite and ageing cohort. The programme's time horizon (see `HORIZON.md`) overlaps directly with the period in which the current Generation IT cohort will retire. This makes deliberate succession — the systematic transfer of end-to-end mental models to the cohort that follows — a first-class concern of the programme rather than a deferred one. Succession at this scale is itself a governance act and is expected to be treated in a successor document at an appropriate time.

## 6. Interaction with layered governance

This principle governs the Build phase. The authoring of per-level governance MD files (Region, Country, State, organisation, mission, deployment, user) is a separate phase and is governed by foundation document [`10002-Certification-Before-Layered-Governance.md`](10002-Certification-Before-Layered-Governance.md).

Per-level governance authors work with AI at their level under their own pairing at their own level. Those pairings are also singular (1 human, 1 Claw at each level) but do not require Generation IT in the same form. A Regional authority authoring Regional governance MD files is authoring policy, not producing a Solution. The Generation IT requirement applies to Solution production; it does not apply to level-specific policy authorship.

---

## 7. Scope

This principle applies to any work that is claimed as TrueAI-aligned or as a component of a UniCORE Solution. It does not apply to:

- Personal-assistant use of AI
- Research and exploratory work not claimed as TrueAI-aligned output
- Ordinary software development outside the UniCORE programme

The principle attaches to the claim, not to the tool.

## 8. Summary

| Rule | Statement |
|---|---|
| 1:1 at the Claw | One human per Solution-producing Claw; one Claw per workstream |
| Project separation | Each distinct Solution receives its own Claw |
| Board above, not within | A small human board may sit above the pairing; it does not share the session |
| Pattern 1 | Direct singular pairing produces the Solution |
| Pattern 2 | Parallel isolated pairings produce prototypes; a fresh pair synthesises the Solution |
| Synthesis pair | Must be fresh to the prototypes and must itself be a singular pairing |
| Producer qualification | Generation IT — 30+ years, full-vertical experience |
| Named authority | Attaches to the Solution-producing pair; in Pattern 2 that is the synthesis pair |
