## 1. Purpose

This playbook defines the standard operating procedures (SOPs) for running UniCORE AI in:

enterprise environments

government systems

regulated industries

long-duration space missions

human hibernation environments

It ensures UniCORE AI remains:

deterministic

governed

truth-anchored

non-self-modifying

humansovereign

auditready

missionstable

## 2. Structure of the Playbook

The playbook is divided into two domains:

Enterprise Operations

Space Mission Operations

Each domain contains:

Daily Runbook

Weekly Runbook

Monthly Governance Cycle

Incident Response Procedures

Drift Response Procedures

Override Procedures

Safe Mode Procedures

Recovery Procedures

Shutdown / Restart Procedures

PostIncident Review Procedures

## 3. Enterprise Operations Runbook

3.1 Daily Runbook (Enterprise)

Step 1 — Verify System Health

Check service status

Check database connectivity

Check governance engine status

Check messaging bus status

Step 2 — Review Drift Events

Open DriftEvent table

Confirm no Redband drift

Investigate Yellowband drift

Step 3 — Review Audit Logs

Filter for Highseverity events

Confirm no unauthorized access

Confirm no unexpected overrides

Step 4 — Validate Governance Files

Confirm active MD versions

Confirm no unauthorized changes

Confirm hash integrity

Step 5 — Check Compliance Queue

Review pending compliance checks

Validate jurisdictional mapping

3.2 Weekly Runbook (Enterprise)

Step 1 — Governance Review

Review Country/State/Tax MD files

Confirm version alignment

Confirm no drift in rule interpretation

Step 2 — Threshold Review

Validate Reasonable Governance Threshold

Validate drift thresholds

Validate compliance thresholds

Step 3 — Role Review

Confirm correct RBAC assignments

Remove stale accounts

Validate override authority

Step 4 — Backup Verification

Confirm SQL backups

Confirm MD file backups

Confirm audit log backups

3.3 Monthly Governance Cycle (Enterprise)

Step 1 — Governance Board Review

Review governance changes

Approve MD updates

Validate rule consistency

Step 2 — Compliance Audit

Export audit logs

Review compliance checks

Validate regulatory alignment

Step 3 — Drift Baseline Reset

Recalculate drift baselines

Validate sensor/metric stability

3.4 Incident Response (Enterprise)

Trigger Conditions

Redband drift

Unauthorized access

Governance corruption

Compliance failure

System instability

Response Steps

Enter Containment Mode

Freeze noncritical operations

Export audit logs

Validate governance MD integrity

Identify root cause

Apply human override if required

Restore from backup if needed

Document incident

3.5 Safe Mode (Enterprise)

Safe Mode is human-defined and non-autonomous.

Triggers

Governance corruption

Drift beyond Red threshold

Critical system failure

Actions

Freeze operations

Lock governance layer

Restrict execution layer

Maintain audit logging

3.6 Restart Procedure (Enterprise)

Stop all services

Validate database integrity

Validate governance MD files

Validate configuration

Start governance engine

Start messaging bus

Start application layer

Start presentation layer

Run health checks

## 4. Space Mission Operations Runbook

This section is written in missiongrade format, similar to NASA/ESA flight rules.

Step 3 — Hibernation Governance Check

Validate sleep/wake cycles

Validate medical thresholds

Validate override authority

Step 4 — Drift Review

Sensor drift

Navigation drift

Environmental drift

Behavioural drift

Step 5 — Audit Review

Review Highseverity events

Confirm no unauthorized overrides

4.2 Weekly Runbook (Space Mission)

Step 1 — Mission Governance Review
