## 1. Purpose

This guide defines how to deploy UniCORE AI into:

enterprise environments

government systems

regulated industries

hybrid cloud/onpremise infrastructures

missioncritical operational environments

It ensures deployments remain:

deterministic

governed

truth-anchored

non-self-modifying

compliant with the TrueAI Constitution

## 2. Deployment Principles

2.1 Deterministic Execution

All components must run in deterministic mode:

no probabilistic scheduling

no autonomous background tasks

no emergent processes

2.2 Immutable Core

The TrueAI Foundation and governance MD files must be:

readonly

versioncontrolled

externally stored

human-authored only

2.3 Human-Anchored Control

All write operations require:

human authentication

human authorization

human intent

2.4 Zero Self-Modification

UniCORE AI must not:

update itself

patch itself

extend itself

generate new rules

2.5 Auditability

All actions must be:

logged

timestamped

immutable

exportable

## 3. System Architecture

UniCORE AI is deployed as a threetier system:

Presentation Layer (Blazor / WebAPI / Win)

Application Layer (XAF Modules)

Governance Layer (TrueAI Foundation + 12 Levels)

Persistence Layer (XPO + SQL Server/PostgreSQL)

## 4. Deployment Models

UniCORE AI supports four deployment models:

4.1 OnPremise (Recommended for Government & Regulated Industries)

Characteristics:

full data sovereignty

no external dependencies

highest security

deterministic environment

Requirements:

Windows Server 2025 or Linux

SQL Server 2022 or PostgreSQL 16

.NET 10 runtime

XAF 25.2.7

4.2 Hybrid Cloud

Characteristics:

governance layer onpremise

application layer in cloud

presentation layer anywhere

Requirements:

Azure App Service / Azure Kubernetes Service

Azure SQL or onprem SQL

secure VPN or ExpressRoute

4.3 Full Cloud (Enterprise)

Characteristics:

fastest deployment

scalable

suitable for nonregulated industries

Requirements:

Azure App Service

Azure SQL

Azure Key Vault

4.4 AirGapped Deployment (Defense / Space)

Characteristics:

no internet access

fully isolated

deterministic environment

long-duration stability

Requirements:

offline package repository

offline governance MD store

offline audit export

## 5. Core Components

5.1 Governance Engine

Handles:

MD file parsing

rule validation

threshold enforcement

drift detection

Must run in readonly mode for governance files.

5.2 Inter-Level Messaging Bus

Implements ILMP (from section Q):

no horizontal messaging

no autonomous messaging

no message loops

no multihop messages

Transport options:

SQL deterministic queue

XPO message table

Azure Service Bus (deterministic mode)

5.3 Audit Engine

Stores:

truth events

evidence events

compliance checks

overrides

drift events

execution logs

Audit tables must be appendonly.

5.4 Override Engine

Implements the Human Override Protocol:

immediate execution

no challenge

no delay

no reinterpretation

## 6. Security Model

6.1 Authentication

Supported:

Azure AD

Active Directory

## Adfs

OAuth2

All write operations require human identity.

6.2 Authorization

Roles:

Governance Officer

Compliance Officer

System Administrator

Mission Commander (space)

Medical Officer (space)

Auditor

AI cannot hold roles.

6.3 Secrets Management

Use:

Azure Key Vault

HashiCorp Vault

Onprem HSM

AI cannot access secrets autonomously.

6.4 Network Segmentation

Recommended:

Governance Layer: isolated subnet

Application Layer: internal subnet

Presentation Layer: DMZ or internal

Database Layer: private subnet

## 7. Deployment Steps

Step 1 — Provision Infrastructure

Create SQL database

Deploy application servers

Deploy governance server

Configure network segmentation

Step 2 — Install UniCORE AI

Deploy XAF modules

Deploy governance engine

Deploy messaging bus

Deploy audit engine

Step 3 — Load Governance MD Files

Load:

Country_Governance.md

State_Governance.md

Tax_Governance.md

Compliance_Governance.md

Mission_Governance.md (if applicable)

Files must be:

human-authored

signed

versioned

Step 4 — Configure Thresholds

Load:

Reasonable Governance Threshold

Drift thresholds

Compliance thresholds

Step 5 — Configure Roles

Assign:

Governance Officers

Compliance Officers

Administrators

Override Officers

Step 6 — Run Validation

System performs:

schema validation

governance validation

messaging validation

drift baseline creation

Step 7 — Begin Operation

UniCORE AI enters:

deterministic mode

governed mode

audit mode

## 8. Monitoring & Maintenance

8.1 Monitoring

Monitor:

drift events

audit logs

compliance checks

override frequency

message flow

8.2 Maintenance

Allowed:

patching OS

patching .NET

patching XAF

Not allowed:

modifying TrueAI Foundation

modifying governance MD files without human approval

modifying architecture

## 9. Disaster Recovery

9.1 Backup Strategy

Backup:

SQL database

governance MD files

audit logs

configuration files

Frequency:

daily full

hourly differential

9.2 Restore Strategy

Restores must:

preserve immutability

preserve audit logs

preserve governance versions

## 10. Why This Guide Matters

This deployment guide ensures UniCORE AI remains:

safe

governed

deterministic

compliant

human-anchored

long-duration stable

It is suitable for:

banks

governments

healthcare

defense

space missions

global enterprises
