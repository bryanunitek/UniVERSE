## 1. Overview

The UniCORE AI API is a deterministic, governed interface that exposes the 12Level architecture through controlled, non-autonomous endpoints.

The API:

does not allow self-modification

does not allow rule creation

does not allow internal heartbeats

does not allow emergent processes

does not allow autonomous inter-level communication

All operations are explicit, humantriggered, and governed by MD files.

## 2. API Design Principles

2.1 Deterministic

Every request produces a predictable, auditable response.

2.2 Non-Self-Modifying

No endpoint can alter:

architecture

rules

governance files

thresholds

system behaviour

2.3 Human-Anchored

All write operations require:

human authentication

human authorization

human intent

2.4 Truth-Anchored

All truthlevel responses must:

cite evidence

classify uncertainty

never fabricate

2.5 GovernanceBound

All operations must respect:

TrueAI Constitution

Reasonable Governance Threshold

Human Override Protocol

## 3. API Structure

The API is divided into five domains:

/truth

/evidence

/governance

/operations

/audit

Each domain maps directly to UniCORE Levels.

## 4. Endpoints

4.1 /truth — Level 1

GET /truth/verify

Verifies a factual claim.

Request:

{

  "claim": "string",

  "context": "optional string"

}

Response:

{

  "status": "TRUE | FALSE | UNVERIFIED",

  "evidence": [...],

  "confidence": 0.0–1.0,

  "notes": "string"

}

Rules:

No fabrication

No inference beyond evidence

Must return UNVERIFIED when uncertain

4.2 /evidence — Level 2

POST /evidence/submit

{

  "evidenceId": "GUID",

  "classification": "primary | secondary | contextual"

}

Rules:

AI cannot generate evidence

Only humans may submit

  "details": {...}

}

4.5 /interpretation — Level 5

POST /interpretation/derive

No autonomous execution

Must respect governance

4.9 /execution — Level 9

Runs a deterministic action.

Request:

{

  "task": "string",

  "inputs": {...}

}

Response:

{

  "output": {...},

  "auditId": "GUID"

}

4.10 /audit — Level 10

Response:

{

  "entries": [...]

## 5. Authentication

All write operations require:

human identity

human signature

human intent

AI cannot authenticate itself.

## 6. Rate Limits

There are no autonomous rate limits.All limits are human-defined.

## 7. Error Model

Errors must be:

deterministic

humanreadable

nonfabricated

Example:

{

  "error": "RULE_CONFLICT",

  "details": "Action violates Tax_Governance.md section 4.2"

}
